query_satellite_data —————————————————————————

In AWS s3, I have a bucket: wb-blackmarble with the following three files:

gadm_410/ADM_0/ABW/blackmarble/annual/2021.dta

gadm_410/ADM_0/ABW/blackmarble/annual/2022.dta

gadm_410/ADM_0/ABW/blackmarble/annual/2023.dta

Write a Stata function where the user inputs:
iso = “AWB”
years = 2020 2021 2022
file_name = “~/Desktop/ntl.dta”

The function name should be: download_country_data

The function should do the following:

1. Create a folder:
 “~/Desktop/ntl_dta_individual_files”

The folder name should reflect the name of the users input of file_name. For example, if the user sets:
file_name = “~/Desktop/dataset.dta”

the created folder should be:
  “~/Desktop/dataset_dta_individual_files”

2. Create a sub-folder for the iso. This would be:
 “~/Desktop/ntl_dta_individual_files/AWB”

3. Download all relevant and available AWS files into the folder created into step 2. 

Note the input specifies 2020, 2021, and 2022. However, the 2020 dataset is not available. The function should not break down here. Here, the function would download:

gadm_410/ADM_0/ABW/blackmarble/annual/2021.dta

gadm_410/ADM_0/ABW/blackmarble/annual/2022.dta

into:

 “~/Desktop/ntl_dta_individual_files/AWB”

Before downloading, the function should check if the file already exists (ie, it is already downloaded); if it does exist, the function should skip downloading because the file is already downloaded.

4. Append all .dta files in:

 “~/Desktop/ntl_dta_individual_files/AWB”

5. Save the appended dataset as:

“~/Desktop/ntl.dta”

Please let me know if I should clarify anything before you create the function.


* query_geojson -------------------------------------------

In AWS s3, I have a bucket: wb-blackmarble with the following files:

https://wb-blackmarble.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/gadm_410/ADM_0/ABW/ABW.geojson
https://wb-blackmarble.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/gadm_410/ADM_0/AFG/AFG.geojson

Write a function in Stata where the user inputs:
geo_dataset(“gadm_410”)
adm_level(“ADM_0”)
iso(“ABW”)
file_name(“~/Desktop/country_file.geojson”)

And where the function downloads the .geojson to file_name
